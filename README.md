> [!NOTE]
> 
> This repository is a personal fork of the **Mindful** app, focused on a **stricter Invincible mode**.  
> In this fork, Invincible mode’s disable window is tied to a fixed timezone and a monotonic time source, so it cannot be bypassed by manually changing the device clock.
>
> Apart from this change, the app behaves the same as the original Mindful project.
